Java keystores and truststores
==============================

.. _server_java_keystore:

Java keystore file for TLS
--------------------------

Access to the Trino coordinator must be through HTTPS when using Kerberos
and LDAP authentication. The Trino coordinator uses a :ref:`Java Keystore
<server_java_keystore>` file for its TLS configuration. These keys are
generated using :command:`keytool` and stored in a Java Keystore file for the
Trino coordinator.

The alias in the :command:`keytool` command line should match the principal that the
Trino coordinator uses.

You'll be prompted for the first and last name. Use the Common Name that will
be used in the certificate. In this case, it should be the unqualified hostname
of the Trino coordinator. In the following example, you can see this in the prompt
that confirms the information is correct:

.. code-block:: text

    keytool -genkeypair -alias trino -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks
    Enter keystore password:
    Re-enter new password:
    What is your first and last name?
      [Unknown]:  trino-coordinator.example.com
    What is the name of your organizational unit?
      [Unknown]:
    What is the name of your organization?
      [Unknown]:
    What is the name of your City or Locality?
      [Unknown]:
    What is the name of your State or Province?
      [Unknown]:
    What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
      [Unknown]:
    Is CN=trino-coordinator.example.com, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct?
      [no]:  yes

    Enter key password for <trino>
            (RETURN if same as keystore password):

.. _cli_java_truststore:

Java truststore file for TLS
----------------------------

Truststore files contain certificates of trusted TLS/SSL servers, or of
Certificate Authorities trusted to identify servers. For securing access
to the Trino coordinator through HTTPS, the clients can configure truststores.
For the Trino CLI to trust the Trino coordinator, the coordinator's certificate
must be imported to the CLI's truststore.

You can either import the certificate to the default Java truststore, or to a
custom truststore. You should be careful, if you choose to use the default
one, since you may need to remove the certificates of CAs you do not deem trustworthy.

You can use :command:`keytool` to import the certificate to the truststore.
In the example, we are going to import ``trino_certificate.cer`` to a custom
truststore ``trino_trust.jks``, and you get a prompt asking if the certificate
can be trusted or not.

.. code-block:: text

    $ keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias trino_trust -file trino_certificate.cer -keystore trino_trust.jks -keypass <truststore_pass>

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. _troubleshooting_keystore:

Java keystore file verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Verify the password for a keystore file and view its contents using `keytool
<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/keytool.html>`_.

.. code-block:: text

    $ keytool -list -v -keystore /etc/trino/trino.jks
